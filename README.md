### Reflections and Comments
This design sheet has an odd dimension to the viewport that is not 1920x1080 or 16:9, I'm wondering if its 1080x1920 or 9:16? Either way, because of the nature of flexbox the elements do not line up perfectly like they do in the design sheet unless the browser window is at a altered/specific size but I think I got the fundmentals for this lab down.
